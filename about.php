          <p>
            An online voting system that will replace the old ballot system or
            paper system. Over the time we have utilized the required technology
            in every sector to improve efficiency and save the extra resources.
            But the voting system is still very expensive and requires a bigger
            workforce. The system is slower and still not completely tamper
            proof. We bring the system that is safe, reliable and solves the
            modern issues like higher reachability of the booth, crowd-free
            voting, inexpensive, faster results and others.
